# Crime Analysis in Los Angeles City from 2020 to present

INTRODUCTION: This project analyses crime patterns in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024. The dashboards provide insights into various aspects of crime, including crime demographics, severity levels, reporting efficiency, and crime trends across different areas of the city. These visualizations allow filtering by year, area, victim sex, and other demographic factors, offering a comprehensive view of how crime impacts different groups and how reporting trends evolve over time.

FUTURE WORK: Future work may involve integrating more recent crime data to observe post-2024 trends and enhancing the geographic precision of area-based crime reports. I would love to implement predictive models to forecast crime patterns based on the existing data. 

UNDERSTANDING THE DASHBOARD: This storyboard consists of three main dashboards, which you can navigate by clicking on their names. The first dashboard, Crime Overview, provides a general overview of crimes in Los Angeles. You can filter by year and further by area name to gain specific insights. The second dashboard, Crime Demographics, allows filtering by year and gender, providing insights into crime patterns based on demographics. Lastly, the Reporting Analysis dashboard offers insights into the reporting of incidents by demographics and area, with additional filtering by year to analyze trends over time.
